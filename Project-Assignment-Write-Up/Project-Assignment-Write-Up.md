<h1> Project Assignment Write Up </h1>
<h2>Group 4 (Full Stack 2)</h2>

<h3>Project Concept</h3> 
We are developing a music-themed game app, inspired by the popular game Wordle. 
Players will be given 10 attempts to guess the female musical artist of the day using clues based on their previous attempts. 
Uniquely, the game focuses on female musical artists, bringing a spotlight to women in the music industry. 
<br>

<h3>Who will this help?</h3>

Our target demographic includes puzzle enthusiasts and commuters; anyone who enjoys playing a quick brain teaser every day. This is also particularly aimed at anyone who is interested in discovering and supporting female artists. 

<h3>Methods and Tools of Work</h3>

Our primary channel of communication is Slack. 
Our team undertakes daily meetings using Google Teams. We also do individual research and tasks based on the action items set in the meetings. 
<br>
We use Google Drive to manage and store our project-related documents e.g. minutes, research. 
We have used competitive audit templates to research similar applications and draw up their pros/cons.
We have been using Figma to design the Wireframe and UI of our app. 
<br>
Once the app creation is underway, we will be using JIRA to break down and manage our project. 

<h3>Organizing the Workload</h3>

We will be using JIRA for project and role management. 
Once our wireframe and the key screens/features of our app have been finalized, we intend to divide the application by its features and then allocate them to the team members based on strengths/preferences.
<br>
This ensures that team members will feel comfortable in their tasks and will get to experience both front/back-end coding.
