# Wireframes

This folder contains screenshots of wireframes that we have all created individually. They include key features we have discussed in our group meetings. Below is our list of project priorities and maybes. Some wireframes demonstrate these extra features such as the 'About us' page and progress bar. 

Our next step is to create a final collaboratve wireframe including prioritised features. If time allows, we will consider adding extra features down the line. We will also use the final wireframe to decide on style (colours, fonts etc).

### Project Priorities

#### Priorities:
- Guess a woman within 10 guesses
- One category – musicians (initially at least)
- The give up button
- Different levels of difficulties e.g. ‘Easy - top 100’.
